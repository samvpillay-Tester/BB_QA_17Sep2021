### BB QA Test Solution
NOTE: Normally multiple projects would not be in the same repo 
(barring a mono repo)
but this is a test solution

### 1.Manual_Test_Cases
Manual test case details following requirements 1#, please refer to:
./1.Manual_Test_Cases/ReadMe.md

### 2.UI_Automation
Original UI_Automation carried out in Cypress 
along with manual test case details 
following requirements 1# & #2, please refer to:
./2.UI_Automation/ReadMe.md

### 3.API_Automation
Postman based API testing 
(Newman CLI script not added \ not available on this box for me to test)
Two environment files, one for secure requests, one for insecure 
(rather than deployment environment related)
